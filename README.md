Welcome to my Machine Learning Internship Portfolio! In this repository, 
you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. 
Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving.

Below is a summary of the projects:
Task_4 - SPAM SMS DETECTION Description: 
Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. 
Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages. 
I have used Logistic Regression.

I am grateful for the opportunity provided by CodSoft. I have learnt a lot from this experience and hope to use that to further my expertise!!!
